# NLP
Compilation of Python programming codes.

## Description
  The project demonstrates sentimemnt analyses on a dataset using a pre-trained long short-term memory model (LSTM) and Naive Bayes classification.
  For hyperparameter selection, I employ Bayesian optimization to determine those values.

## File Structure
